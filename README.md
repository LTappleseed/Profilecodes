# Profilecodes
CSS and such that I've created or edited. includes RENTRY, AO3 and other skins.

My codes or templates are available for use however you wish, as long as you credit me and do not attach my name to anything illegal, discriminatory, violent or vulgar. Edit as heavily as you would like, but if my name is attached, please keep it recognisable, and appropriate. 

If i used somebody else's code or template as framework, they will be credited. Assume that if i posted them in here, then I have heavily or moderately edited their code or templates. Minor edits will not be posted / announced!

Crediting can be done with my GITHUB username, LTAPPLESEED or my discord, CAUSTICDISCO.

I am an amateur and mostly self-taught developer, looking into getting back into game devving as well. I've previously used scratch and LUA. I'm self-taught for CSS and HTML. I am looking into learning Python and Java.

Questions? DM me.
